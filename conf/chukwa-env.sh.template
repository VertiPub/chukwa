# Set Chukwa-specific environment variables here.

# The only required environment variable is JAVA_HOME.  All others are
# optional.  When running a distributed configuration it is best to
# set JAVA_HOME in this file, so that it is correctly defined on
# remote nodes.

# The java implementation to use.  Required.
#export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun

# Optional (.ie. will try sensible defaults)
# The location of the Hadoop the collector should use. Chukwa uses this to 
# find the hadoop classes or jars as well as the hadoop executables
# for running the mapreduce demux job. Chukwa will look first in
# HADOOP_HOME/build for a hadoop-*-core.jar file, 
# then in HADOOP_HOME/build/classes for hadoop classes.
# If you want to use a hadoop jar straight up, without
# a HADOOP_HOME/bin directory, you should set HADOOP_JAR (below), but
# then chukwa mapreduce jobs wont work. If HADOOP_HOME is not set, default
# assumes that this chukwa is living in hadoop's src/contrib directory, but
# if jars or classes can not be found using that default assumption, 
# Chukwa will default to the hadoop jars that come with it
# in the hadoopjars directory. 
#export HADOOP_HOME="/home/user/Development/hadoop-trunk"

# Optional (i.e. will try sensible defaults)
# The location of a hadoop jars. Setting this will overrided the search for 
# hadoop jars described above (using HADOOP_HOME). If HADOOP_JAR is not set, 
# the default is to check HADOOP_HOME/build (above) for 
# jars or classes, if those are not found, uses hadoop jars which
# come with chukwa in $CHUKWA_HOME/hadoopjars. YOU SHOULD ONLY NEED TO 
# USE THIS IF YOU ARE RUNNING A COLLECTOR WITHOUT A RUNNING 
# HDFS! (i.e. writing datasink sequence files to local disk). Be careful 
# if you use HDFS for chukwa storage, but haven't built the 
# hadoop classes or jar because chukwa will use the default hadoop jars 
# that come with ckukwa, you can easily suffer
# errors due to protocol mismatch between hadoop versions.
#export HADOOP_JAR=${HADOOP_HOME}/build/hadoop-*-core.jar

# The location of chukwa data repository (in either HDFS or your local
# file system, whichever you are using)

#export CHUKWA_PID_DIR="/tmp/chukwa-pid-dir"

# The location of chukwa logs, defaults to CHUKWA_HOME/logs
