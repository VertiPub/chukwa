Check for an updated copy of this README at http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Chukwa_Configuration

Chukwa comes with templates for all configuration files. These files are in the conf directory and are named <conf file name>.template. You should be able to just make a copy of each of these files, removing the ".template" suffix.

'''Required configuration files'''

 * conf/collectors - new line delimited list of collectors. This file is used by startup and shutdown scripts to determine where to run Chukwa  
 * collectors and is also used by Chukwa agents to find collectors to send their data to.
 * conf/chukwa-agents - a list of hosts in the cluster on which to run the Chukwa agent daemon.
 * conf/chukwa-env.sh - environment variables required to run Chukwa.
 * conf/chukwa-collectors-conf.xml - collector specific settings (e.g. port number to listen for agents on, which file system to store data in, etc.)
 * conf/chukwa-agents-conf.xml - agent specific settings.

'''Optional configuration files'''

 * conf/alert.conf - a list of e-mail addresses to which chukwa alerts should be sent.
 * conf/initial_adaptors - a list of adaptors to add to all agents at startup time.
