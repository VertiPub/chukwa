  	<p>
  	  Log processing was one of the original purposes of MapReduce. Unfortunately,
  	  using Hadoop for MapReduce processing of logs is somewhat troublesome. 
  	  Logs are generated incrementally across many machines, but Hadoop MapReduce
  	  works best on a small number of large files. And HDFS doesn't currently
  	  support appends, making it difficult to keep the distributed copy fresh.
  	  </p>
  	  <p>
  	  Chukwa is a Hadoop subproject devoted to bridging that gap between logs
  	   and MapReduce.  Chukwa is a scalable distributed monitoring and analysis
  	   system, particularly logs from Hadoop and other large systems.  
  	</p>
      <p>
        The Chukwa Documentation provides the information you need to get 
        started using Chukwa. You should start with the <a href="design.html">
        Architecture and Design document</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're trying to set up a Chukwa cluster from scratch, you should 
        read the <a href="admin.html"> Chukwa Administration Guide</a> which 
        shows you how to setup and deploy Chukwa. 
      </p>
     <p> If you want to configure the Chukwa agent process, to control what's 
     collected, you should read the <a href="agent.html">Agent Guide</a>. There's
     also a  <a href="collector.html">Collector Guide</a> describing that part of 
     the pipeline.
     </p>
     <p>And if you want to use collected data, read the 
     <a href="programming.html">User and Programming Guide</a></p>
      <p>
		If you have more questions, you can ask on the 
		<a href="ext:lists">Chukwa mailing lists</a>.
